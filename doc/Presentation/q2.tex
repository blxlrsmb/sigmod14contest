\section{Query 2}
\begin{frame}{Query 2}
Given $k$ and $d$, find top-$k$ tags with largest range. Here the
range of a tag $T$ in graph $G(V, E)$ is defined as the size of the
largest subgraph $G(V', E')$ s.t. $\forall v \in V ,v_d > d,  T \in v_t $.

\textbf{Solution:} First sort all the queries and vertices by $d$ in descending order.
Build an empty graph $G_0$ and incrementally insert sorted
vertices and their corresponding edges to $G_0$ .
  During the insertion, we maintain the top-$k$ largest connected
components for each tag using Union-Find Set. A query $q$ would
finish as soon as all vertices $v$ with $v_d>q_d$ are inserted.
